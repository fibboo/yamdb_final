# yatube and yamdb merged
## About:
I merged two different projects to deploy them together on one server.<br>
Both are work with https. <br><br>
yatube you can visit here https://fibboo.space/ <br>
yamdb is avaliable here https://yamdb.fibboo.space/redoc/

### Requirements:
docker https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ <br>
docker-compose https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/

### How to run:

Clone project and cd to infra
```
git clone git@github.com:fibboo/infra_sp2.git
```
Create .env file as in the template infra/.env.template <br>
Change first and second level domains in infra/nginx/default.conf to yours <br>
Don't forget to set up DNS with your domain registrar<br>
Copy infra/ folder to you server
```
scp -r infra/ user@your-server-ip:/home/user/
```
Login to your server, and run init-letsencrypt.sh. This script will get ssl for your domains
```
ssh user@your-server-ip
chmod +x init-letsencrypt.sh
sudo ./init-letsencrypt.sh
```
Push for magic to happen

After first deploy migrate and collect static.
```
sudo docker-compose exec yatube python manage.py migrate
sudo docker-compose exec yamdb python manage.py migrate
sudo docker-compose exec yatube python manage.py collectstatic
sudo docker-compose exec yamdb python manage.py collectstatic
```
If you want demo data for yatube you can load dump.json
```
sudo docker-compose exec yatube python manage.py loaddata dump.json
```
